    description: "Promotion and Conservation of Community Forest Resources. We are deeply committed to raising awareness and building the capacity of communities in the Himalayan region to effectively manage and -Conserve their natural resources particularly community forest resources. Through extensive research and development efforts, we promote ecologically sensitive and sustainable models that contribute to the strengthening of livelihood and conservation of the delicate Himalayan ecosystem. Our primary mission  is to empower local communities and help them recognize, protect and utilize their forest resources sustainably We believe that this endeaver is not only essential for conserving the delicate Himalayan ecosystem but also for fostering socio-economic development within these communities. One of our significant initiatives is the implementation of the Schedule Tribe and other forest Dweller (Recognition of forest rights) Act 2006, commonly known as Forest Rights Act (FRA) of 2006 in various districts of Himachal Pradesh  viz. Kullu, Bilaspur, Hamirpur, Mandi, Chamba, Kinnaur, and Lahaul and Spiti. Working closely with Gram Sabha’s and Forest Rights Committees we have successfully secured the Community Forest Resources (CFR) rights for 24 Gram Sabha’s villages in District Kullu. Moreover, we are actively involved in pursuing hundreds of CFR claims that are currently pending at the Sub-Divisional Level Committee (SDLC) and the District Level Committee (DLC) in Lahaul and Spiti, Kullu, Hamirpur, and Chamba districts. We understand the importance of recognizing and safeguarding the resource rights of local communities over forests. Our dedicated efforts aim to ensure that these communities have the legal backing to sustainably manage and utilize their forest resources ensuring a balance between human needs and ecological conservation. We are committed to continuing our efforts to support the implementation of the Forest Rights Act and PESA, working closely with communities, government bodies, and stakeholders to protect and promote the sustainable management of community forest resources in the Himalayas. Through our collective actions, we strive to create a harmonious balance between human needs and environmental conservation for a resilient and thriving Himalayan ecosystem."

    title: "Sustainable Tourism",
    description: "People owned people governed tourism. Promotion and Development of Community-Based Tourism: Our aim is to encourage ethical, sustainable, and community-based tourism practices in the Himalayas. We firmly believe that tourism can be a catalyst for socio-economic growth while preserving the region’s cultural and environmental heritage. We offer capacity-building programs and knowledge-sharing opportunities, and we actively support the establishment and management of village-level tourism institutions. Empowering Himalayan Communities through Sustainable Tourism. Our mission is to harness the immense potential of tourism as a catalyst for socio-economic growth while safeguarding the unique cultural and environmental heritage of this pristine landscape. We firmly believe that tourism can be a powerful force for positive change, benefitting both travelers and the local communities they visit. By championing community-based tourism, we empower the people of the Himalayas to actively participate in and derive lasting benefits from the tourism industry. This inclusive approach not only fosters sustainable development but also ensures the preservation of the region’s natural beauty and authentic traditions. PHDT actively engages with the Panchayats of Banjar Block, collaborating under the Panchayati Raj Act to develop and regulate tourism through a comprehensive tourism development plan. Our close collaboration with the Panchayati Raj Institution Special Sharchi Panchayat has enabled us to successfully pass the plan through gram sabhas, marking a significant step towards sustainable tourism practices. The plan is now awaiting final notification by the esteemed Deputy Commissioner of Kullu and the Chief Secretary of the Government of Himachal Pradesh. People-Owned, People-Governed Tourism, Central to our vision is the revolutionary “People-Owned, People-Governed Tourism Model.” Together with five Panchayats in District Kullu and Lahaul and Spiti—Burua, Shanan, Palchan, Koksar, and Sissu—we empower local communities to reclaim their role as stewards of this breathtaking land. By embracing this model, we ensure that tourism benefits directly enrich the lives of the people and establish a sustainable approach to managing common resources. With the project’s web of village-level, panchayat-level, block-level, and district-level community-based institutions, we are forging a path towards a more responsible and inclusive tourism industry. These institutions will play a pivotal role in ensuring that the benefits of tourism directly reach the grassroots, fostering equitable growth and preserving the Himalayan ecosystem"

    description: "Mental Health and Well Being. The problem of drug abuse and illicit drug trafficking is one that has devastating consequences on all sectors of society, especially among young population. It causes adverse effects on health; an upsurge in crime, violence, and corruption; the draining of human, natural and financial resources that might otherwise be used for social and economic development; the destruction of individuals, families and communities; and the undermining of political, cultural, social and economic structures. We understand the critical importance of addressing issues related to drug addiction and substance abuse to create and healthier and happier society. Our recent initiative: EHSAS (Celebrating choices)IRCA is responsible for preventive education and awareness generation which target groups (vulnerable and at-risk groups) in their neighborhood. IRCA envisages total recovery of the people with substance use disorders leading to their socio-economic rehabilitation through an appropriate combination of individual counseling. In all, IRCA aims at enabling them to achieve total abstinence and improve the quality of their lives. Since last 10 years, People for Himalayan Development in collaboration with Gunjan besides the regular treatment process engage the patients in exploring self, and opportunities of sustainable vocational skills through medium of Art. Our approach is also to share the use of waste and discarded material to create creative saleable and useable products."
